The Hammurabi Project is an experiment in codifying U.S. law - such as the U.S. Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, state laws, etc. - into C#. 

It has two basic components:

  (1) A core library of functions that facilitate the representation of legal rules; and

  (2) Namespaces and classes that have the same structure as U.S. and state legislation, regulations, and case law.

More information can be found on the project wiki (at Github).
