The Hammurabi Project is an experiment in codifying U.S. law - such as the U.S. Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, state laws, etc. - into executable computer code. 

The project's basic components are:

(1) A core library of classes and functions that facilitate the representation of legal knowledge.
(2) Files written in a domain specific language called Akkadian (.akk), which is used to represent the legislation, regulations, and case law.
(3) A primitive compiler that converts the Akkadian files into C#.(4) Unit tests for the core library and the legal rules. 

More information can be found on the project wiki (at Github).
