         * The following string constants represent the text of relationships that
         * can exist between legal entities.  
         * 
         * They are coded as strings to promote referential integrity, to make 
         * maintenance easier, and to take advantage of IntelliSense code completion.
         * Consolidating them also makes it easier to visually scan the relationships.
         * 
         * Incidentally, using constants may also provide a very small performance gain.
         * 
         * Because there are so many relationships that are possible, it is expected
         * that this list will become quite long.  Consequently, this has something
         * of a "Cyc" feel.
         * 
         * This list could alternatively be represented as an enumeration, although
         * doing so would mean that all relationships would then be best represented
         * as integers instead of strings, and that every relationship would have to
         * be part of the enumeration.
