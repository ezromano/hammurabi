# TEMPORAL MAP FUNCTION

# Given a Tnum function, map it along a timeline, starting at a given date
# and continuing for a given number of intervals.
# The numeric function must return a value for each input integer from 1...n. 
Tnum TemporalMap(Func<Tnum,Tnum> fcn, Tdate startDate, Tnum intervalCount, Time.IntervalType intervalType) = 
    fcn(Time.IntervalsSince(startDate, startDate.AddYears(intervalCount), intervalType))
    
    
# TEMPORAL DETERMINATIONS

# Returns true in the period during which a given date falls
# Example: DateIsInPeriod(2013-04-15, TheYear) is true for all of 2013, and otherwise false
Tbool DateIsInPeriod(Tdate date, Tnum temporalPeriod) =
    afterEvent.EverPer(temporalPeriod) &
    afterEvent.CountPastNIntervals(temporalPeriod,1) == 0
    
    Tbool afterEvent = TheTime.IsAtOrAfter(date)

# Creates a new instance of a Thing (if it doesn't already exist)

# ALL KNOWN PEOPLE

# All known people (in user session)
# Uses lower case to indicate uniqueness of function
