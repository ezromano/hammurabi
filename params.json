A core library of C# classes and functions that facilitate the representation of legal knowledge.\r\n1. Legal rule files written in a domain specific language called Akkadian (.akk).\r\n1. A primitive compiler that converts the Akkadian files into C#.\r\n1. Unit tests for the core library and the legal rules. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the [project wiki](https://github.com/mpoulshock/hammurabi/wiki).","google":""}
